The game was originally made in Flash CS and Flex builder and released back around ~2016.
The aim of this project is to build a web port that can run as a native app on iOS and Android.

Current Milestones:

 - Build sound manager (SFX, voice, music theme)

 - Compile and run as iOS app
 - Compile and run as Android app
 - i18n setup the English voice/text version and a language toggle
 - **Complete Development plan/milestones**

Unplaced milestones:
 - Fix none essentiel background interactables in scenes

Completed Milestones:
 - Fix scaling layout
 - Setup beta.themoonmachine.org as a link to this site
 - Basic scene manager for walking through normal scene interactions
 - Basic application architecture and technical plan
 - POC, is this even possible???

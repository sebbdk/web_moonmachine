# Sofus & the Moonmachine

If you found this then congrats, you are currently looking at the the restoration project for Sofus & the Moonmachine!

The project is still in the early fases, but a contact email for feedback will be added later.
Meanwhile, feel free to look around.

The game was originally made in Flash CS and Flex builder and released back around ~2016.
The aim of this project is to build a web port that can run as a native app on iOS and Android.

Current Milestones:
 - Load scenes in a consistent way
 - Proceed to next scene when scene is done
 - Create a demo with the first 10 scenes (no counting any minigames)
 - Compile and run as iOS app
 - Compile and run as Android app
 - **Complete Development plan**

Complete Milestones:
 - Basic scene manager for walking through normal scene interactions
 - Basic application architecture and technical plan
 - POC, is this even possible???


Technical notes:
 - hwo to grab the right movie clip instance? (instance_1??)

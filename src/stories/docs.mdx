# Sofus & the Moonmachine

If you found this then congrats, you are currently looking at the restoration project for Sofus & the Moonmachine!

The project is still in the early phases, but a contact email for feedback will be added later.
Meanwhile, feel free to look around.

The game was originally made in Flash CS and Flex builder and released back around ~2016.
The aim of this project is to build a web port that can run as a native app on iOS and Android.

## Current project status:

See the milestones [or the dev logs](/docs/readme-logs--docs) for more details.

# Dev Logs

### <hr /> Seb, Monday 15. October 2024

 * The server managing the website was frozen, it is now functional again.
 * The first 10 scenes and the chapter scenes have been added
	* They are none functional, but will load and run their animations

I finished the basic milestones plan along with some initial dates for when things should be completed.

I also setup this log to document the status of the project.

For now this is mostly for my self and the game designer to reference but this may change in the future.

Week 3 goals:
 - Migrate first 10 scenes badly (they just need to load basically)
 - Implement none POC/hacked sound manager for SFX, scene music and Voice.
 - Fix/generalize how scenes are loaded more better

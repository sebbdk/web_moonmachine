### <hr /> Seb, Thursday 24. October 2024

 - Fixed touch interactions on mobile
 - Added missing tween animation when item is dropped in scene 5
 - Solved how hitArea and hit detection can be done simpler
 - Added missing scene interactions in scene 0
 - Added missing scene interactions in scene 3
 - Finished migrating scene 4


Finally satisfied with the drag & drop for scene 5, i added the missing tween and also made sure touch interactions now work properly.

Got a lot of scenes to playable today, the last simpler scene in this batch is the racer assembly game.

Scene status:
 - Scene 1-10 interactions
	- <span style="color: green">Scene 0 - Done</span>
	- <span style="color: orange">Scene 1 - Mostly done</span>
		- Can forward to early?
		- Missing background interactables
	- <span style="color: green">Scene 2 - Done</span>
	- <span style="color: orange">Scene 3 - Mostly Done</span>
		- Animation error, Sofus glitches for a second when he turns towards the end of the scene
	- <span style="color: green">Scene 4 - Done</span>
	- <span style="color: orange">Scene 5 - Mostly Done</span>
		- Can next too much on Finally
		- The fly animation does not execute properly when exported
	- <span style="color: orange">Scene 6 - Mostly done</span>
		- Animation error, lit fuse light does not follow the fuse
		- Animation error, Sofus flies out of the rocket when in flies
	- Scene 7 - Untouched (rocket game)
	- <span style="color: orange">Scene 8 - Mostly done</span>
		- The background city light animations only show when debug is enabled
		- There is a playSound error in terminal when scene is run
	- Scene 9 - Untouched (shake tablet)
		- There is an animation error when the scene starts (possibly a loop code issue?)
		- Needs a POC of the accelerometer access (R&D says it should be possible)
	- Scene 10 - Untouched (assemble racer)
		- There are some loopFrom related errors in the terminal when run
 - GUI
	- Back & forward buttons
	- Better/dynamic scaling
	- Storyteller text formatting
	- Use Arrow key shortcuts instead of enter for back/forward
 - Scene transition/continue/load next scene when scene completes

Back from vacation and working on scene 5 continued from the work i did in the Airport this Monday.

The hitTest and drag and drop is being tedious to get working since the API i am supposed to use for it is unclear.

Got the basics working, hitTest is finicky but the way it works should be re-usable for the maze scene which is good news.

 * Got drag the assemble rocket minigame working, the scene still needs work.
 * Found a way to get the Maze scene working as before by hit detection

Taking a break at the hotel and working a bit.

 * Added fire swipe to scene 8 and fixed the background interactables
	* Scene is practically done, just needs testing

The swipe helped function came in clutch, made this really easy. :)

Working on the plane on my way to Italy for a short vacation today.

 * Finished misc click scene interactions for scene 2
 * Made a generalized method to handle clicks
 * Solved how to make invisible interaction areas
 * Fixed scene 6 click issues and added the rocket swipe

I've left the interactions areas on, the migrated ones will have a blue square on them. The areas can be disabled by disabling debugging later on.
The green areas are interaction areas not yet migrated.

I plan to make one for swipe etc. too.

Ran into a really odd thing, all the green interaction squares are 224x378 in size, despite clearly being different in size.
Some how whe ni use this number to defined their size the click area is the appropriate size.

 * Found a way to simplify the click helper, the magic number is no longer needed

Adobe black magic fuckery i guess.

### <hr /> Seb, Thursday 17. October 2024

 * Finished Migrating generic scene methods for scene 4-10

Some of the code is located in the Sc0X.as files, so scenes like scene 9 need more work.

Most of the code for the custom interactions looks like it just needs some simple AS to JS porting.

I should make a generic for swipe and click and also find away to expose the cursor position for the drag code.

(Also need to find out Accelerometer access for the shake)

### <hr /> Seb, Wednesday 16. October 2024

 * Made following scenes traversable
	* Scene 1
	* Scene 3

Slow day, i realized quite a few of the first scenes have click actions.
Maybe i can/should generalize this into the injectable class.

### <hr /> Seb, Tuesday 15. October 2024

 * The server managing the website was frozen, it is now functional again.
 * The first 10 scenes and the chapter scenes have been added
	* They are none functional, but will load and run their animations
 * Implemented an AudioManager and removed the global hacks
	* This fixes the bug where audio would stop working on navigation.
 * Made the scene music play (the volume needs adjusting)
 * Loading will take longer now, this is because all the sounds are now preloaded
	* An optimization later could be to preload only the first few voice lines
		* This wont matter when this becomes an app.
 * I updated the milestones status and made come clarifications to existing ones

This pretty much completes the goals i made for the week so i'm adding to the scope.

**Updated week 3 goals**:
 - <span style="color: green">Migrate first 10 scenes badly (they just need to load basically) - DONE</span>
 - <span style="color: green">Implement none POC/hacked sound manager for SFX, scene music and Voice. - DONE</span>
 - <span style="color: green">Fix/generalize how scenes are loaded more better.  - DONE</span>
 - Implement basic actions for scene 0->10 (excluding mini games)
 - POC Compile into an iOS app and test on real tablet
 - Simplify scene configuration
 - Setup a toggle to disable sound during development

### <hr /> Seb, Monday 14. October 2024

I finished the basic milestones plan along with some initial dates for when things should be completed.

I also setup this log to document the status of the project.

For now this is mostly for my self and the game designer to reference but this may change in the future.

**Week 3 goals**:
 - Migrate first 10 scenes badly (they just need to load basically)
 - Implement none POC/hacked sound manager for SFX, scene music and Voice.
 - Fix/generalize how scenes are loaded more better
